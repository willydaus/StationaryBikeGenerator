### GOALS
In the modern day, the gym has become an integral part in the lives of many people. It’s a great way for people to burn unwanted calories, stay in shape, and stay healthy. However, this practice of wasting energy also consumes energy. From lighting to air conditioning, the gym contributes, although very small, to the carbon footprint that are slowly changing the world. To reduce this carbon footprint, this project explores the idea of using gym equipments to convert calories into electrical power via a small generator. To illustrate the bigger idea, the goal of this project is to utilize gym equipments such as ellipticals to generate enough power to charge a smartphone. This allows everyone to charge their phone using their own calories even if they are listening to music, watching videos, or even browsing through instagram models. As long as the wheel rotates, the attached small generator will convert the rotational energy of the wheel to small direct current electricity that can charge a phone. While the energy generated is extremely small compare to the modern day power consumption, small steps can hopefully lead to bigger changes.

### POSSIBLE FEATURES

- A generator that is small and can be easily attached to an elliptical at the gym.
- An LCD/OLED screen to display the current amount of power generated.
- An app that can be used to record data, connected to the generator via Bluetooth.

### PRELIMINARY PLAN

This project will be composed of 4 stages, each with sections that can be completed by each member:

- Collecting parts - parts can be bought, borrowed, or already owned. A list will be put together and the all team members will seek out parts.
- Prototyping - a prototype can be made on a breadboard, testing for functionality and feasibility.	
    - Hardware design - Connecting everything from microcontroller to generator together on breadboard.
    - Software design - Arduino/ESP8266 programming.
    - App design - Android/ios app programming.
- Final product - The final product is constructed based on the prototype.
    - Hardware design - Soldering everything from microcontroller to generator together on pcb.
    - Software design - Arduino/ESP8266 programming.
    - App design - Android/ios app programming.
- Testing & modifications - the product will be thoroughly tested and modified as necessary.
    - Does it work as intended? If not, what’s wrong?
    - Does it provide enough power? If not, why? If too much, how can it be more efficient?
    - Does the app work as intended? If not, how can it be fixed?
